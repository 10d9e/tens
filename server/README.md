# Server TypeScript Migration

The server has been successfully migrated from JavaScript to TypeScript. This provides better type safety, improved developer experience, and enhanced maintainability.

## Project Structure

```
server/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts          # Main server file
│   ├── logger.ts         # Winston logger configuration
│   └── types/
│       └── index.ts      # TypeScript type definitions
├── tsconfig.json         # TypeScript configuration
└── README.md            # This file
```

## Key Features

### Type Safety
- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all game entities
- Server-specific types extending client types
- Strict type checking enabled
- Socket.IO event typing

### Enhanced Developer Experience
- IntelliSense support
- Compile-time error detection
- Better refactoring capabilities
- Improved debugging

## Available Scripts

### Development
```bash
# Run server in development mode with ts-node
npm run server:dev

# Run server in development mode with file watching
npm run server:watch

# Run both client and server in development mode
npm run dev:full
```

### Production
```bash
# Build TypeScript to JavaScript
npm run server:build

# Run compiled JavaScript server
npm run server
```

## Type Definitions

### Core Types
- `ServerPlayer`: Player with socket connection info
- `ServerGame`: Game state with server-specific fields
- `ServerTable`: Table with server-specific properties
- `SocketEvents`: Typed Socket.IO events

### Bot AI Types
- `BotPlayer`: Bot player with AI capabilities
- `HumanPlayer`: Human player type
- `SimpleBotAI`: Basic bot AI class
- `AcadienBotAI`: Advanced bot AI class

## Migration Benefits

1. **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time
2. **Better IDE Support**: Full IntelliSense and autocomplete
3. **Refactoring**: Safe renaming and restructuring
4. **Documentation**: Types serve as inline documentation
5. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify code

## Configuration

The TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`) includes:
- Strict type checking
- ES2020 target
- CommonJS modules
- Source maps for debugging
- Declaration files for type exports

## Dependencies

### Runtime Dependencies
- `express`: Web framework
- `socket.io`: Real-time communication
- `winston`: Logging
- `cors`: Cross-origin resource sharing
- `uuid`: Unique identifier generation

### Development Dependencies
- `typescript`: TypeScript compiler
- `ts-node`: TypeScript execution for Node.js
- `@types/express`: Express type definitions
- `@types/cors`: CORS type definitions
- `@types/node`: Node.js type definitions

## Usage

The server maintains full compatibility with the existing client while providing enhanced type safety and developer experience. All existing functionality has been preserved during the migration.
